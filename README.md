# Grape-vine-Leaves-Classification
This is the final project for the data mining course. Using pre-trained models and transfer learning, the aim is to classify the five classes of grapevine leaves. The pre-trained models are MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and others. We see the effects of autoencoders on the accuracy and use 10-fold cross-validation as a measurement.
